# INF560

 This repository is for the homework1 of INF 560  
 Here is to host the 3 required scripts:  
 The 1st script is for generating 1000 random numbers from 0-100  
 The 2nd script is for generating new numbers from the original 1000 using the equation y=3x+6  
 The 3rd scipt is for visualizing the results of the 1st and 2nd steps

## Homework 4

### Question 1:  Create a blank virtual environment in the local repository from homework 2  

At first, I used Github Desktop to clone the Homework2 Repository to local.  
I've done the project by using Python version of 3.7.8.  
Then I installed the virtualenv package by:  
`pip install virtualenv`  
Then I changed the directory to my local clone and created the new environment named dsci560H4:  
`cd C:\Users\Tod Xu\Documents\GitHub\Homework2`  
`py -m venv dsci560H4`  
  
### Question 2: Activate the environment and install the dependencies to run the scripts  

I activated the environment by  
`py -m .\Script\activate`  
I used numpy and matplotlib in my scripts so that I installed 2 of the dependencies in my virtual environment:  
`py -m pip install numpy`  
`py -m pip install matplotlib`  

### Question 3: Run the scripts and screenshot of my terminal with the activated environment after running the script for the number generator.  
Run the 3 scripts from homework2  
`py Random_Number_Generator.py`  
`py Equation_Number_Generator.py`  
`py Visualization.py`  
And here is the scrrenshot of my terminal:
